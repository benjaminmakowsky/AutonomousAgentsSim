How to run a server in XPilot:

================================================================
First, inspect the pvp_base_defense_server file. You should see
a list of ./xpilot-ng-server statements, and all but one should
be commented out. Near the middle of each such statement, you
should see an option that says -map <mapname>, where mapname is
just the name of some map file in the server/ directory. Either
uncomment the line that has the desired map file, or otherwise
make sure that the only uncommented line references the desired
map. Feel free to change of the other server options as desired
also. Then, exit the file, and run the following:

./pvp_base_defense_server

This should start a server that clients can now connect to. If
you then run a client or some AI bots from a different terminal,
they should all spawn in a game on that server, provided there
are enough spawn points for all of them.

How to create a map for the server to use:

================================================================
Navigate to the xpilot-engine/src/mapedit/ directory. Then, run
the following command:

./xpilot-ng-xp-mapedit

This should open up a map editor, in which you can design maps
with walls, fuel depots, some items, friction, and other cool
features. When you click "Save", a box should pop up prompting
you to enter a file name. However, in addition to the filename,
you can also enter a relative path where you want that file to
end up. For example, if I'm creating a map called test-map, and
I want the map to end up in the xpilot-engine/src/server/
directory because it's the server that's going to use this map
file anyway, I can enter the following in the dialogue box:

../server/test-map.xp

This will save my map in the server/ directory under the given
name. Loading is similar: if I were to exit the map editor and
then reopen it, I could continue editing the map I was working
on by clicking "Load" and entering

../server/test-map.xp
