The shipshapes.txt file in the shipshapes folder designates the available 
player units that *can* be spawned.

Shipshapes.txt is parsed by the Xpilot server during runtime, and will 
cross-reference the file contents whenever a client requests a 
particular shipShape ( unit ).

The bitmaps folder contains the bitmaps ( sprite ) that will be drawn
on the client-screen. <unit>.ppm is the default ( white ) player unit.
<unit>_f.ppm is the friendly ( blue ) player unit. <unit>_e.ppm is the 
enemy ( red ) player unit. Any new entries or changes to the bitmap files
need to be reflected in the client code @ xpilot_engine/src/client/x11/bitmaps.c
