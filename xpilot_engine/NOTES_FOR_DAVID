Some quick notes:

xpilot-ng-temp/c/                       <-- this is where the AI bots are written
xpilot-ng-temp/src/client/x11/cAI.c     <-- this is where the AI-lib implementation is

How to run the server( do this before running a client )
cd src/server/
./base_defense_server
This is a script that executes the current rendition of the map with a bunch of 
configuration options that I've been playing around with.

How to run the client ( so that you control the ship )
cd src/client/x11
./base_defense_client < username > < shipShape name >
username can be anything you want
shipShape should be one of the following: quad, fixed, drone_tank or infantry

How to run an AI bot
First have the server running.
cd xpilot-ng-temp/c
Compile the bot you want to run, example: gcc Spinner.c libcAI.so -o Spinner
Another example: gcc StationaryDefender.c libcAI.so -lm -o StationaryDefender
Then run it like so:
./Spinner -team 0 -color0 "#23221f" -join -name < username > -shipShape < quad, fixed, drone_tank or infantry >

Note: At the time of writing and sending this to you, StationaryDefender is buggy and 
just stands still.

Note2: You can have default AI bots spawn by changing the min/max number of robots in the
base_defense_server script, but this *may* crash the server due to some recent changes 
i've made, I haven't tested it
