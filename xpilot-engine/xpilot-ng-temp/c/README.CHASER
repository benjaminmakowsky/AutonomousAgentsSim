How to run our chaser simulator:

=================================================================
First, navigate to the xpilot-engine/src/server/ directory
and run the following:

./getMapPoints.sh <mapfile>

where mapfile is the server's file for the map you want to
use. Then, execute

./pvp_base_defense_server

In another terminal, navigate to xpilot-engine/xpilot-ng-temp/c/
and enter the following:

./buildMapgen.sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./runMapgen.sh 1 points.csv

A window and console will pop up while the map generator agent
generates the map.csv file. When a message pops up saying that
map generation is complete, quit that drone. Rerun the server
as before, then in the xpilot-ng-temp/c/ directory perform the
following:

./buildChaser.sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./runChaser.sh <n> map.csv

where n is a natural number representing the number of drones
you would like to spawn.
=================================================================

This should spawn n chaser drones, each with a window and a
console, though hopefully we will eventually have a spectator
mode in which only one window will be generated for all the
drones combined.
