How to run our boids simulator:

=======================================================
First, from the xpilot-engine/src/server/ directory,
run a server using the following:

./pvp_base_defense_server

Then, go to xpilot-engine/xpilot-ng-temp/c/ in another
terminal and perform the following:

./buildBoids.sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./runBoids.sh <n>

where n is some natural number indicating the number of 
drones to have on each team.
=======================================================

This should produce 2*n separate windows and consoles, 
one for each drone spawned, though hopefully we will
eventually have a spectator mode in which just a single
window is generated.
