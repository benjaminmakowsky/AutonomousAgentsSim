How to run our boids simulator:

===========================================================
First, from the xpilot_bin/server/ directory,
run a server using the following:

./pvp_base_defense_server

Then, go to xpilot_ai/c/ in another
terminal and perform the following:

./buildBoids.sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./runBoids.sh <n>

where n is some natural number indicating the number of 
drones to have on each team. This should produce 2*n 
separate windows and consoles, one for each drone 
spawned, though hopefully we will eventually have a 
spectator mode in which just a single window is generated.
===========================================================


How to send commands to drones in boids:

===========================================================
This boids simulator comes equipped with a message handler
that accepts commands to change the drones' behavior, using
XPilot's built-in chat feature. To send a command, open the 
chat feature by pressing the 'm' key. Then, type your
message and press Enter/Return.

The following are all the values you can modify through
this message handler:

mobile - whether or not drone's move at all (can be 0 or 1)
wweight - the weight of the wall avoidance vector
aweight - the weight of the alignment vector
cweight - the weight of the cohesion vector
sweight - the weight of the friendly separation vector
sradius - the radius a drone checks for friendly neighbors
            to stay away from (in pixels)
eweight - the weight of the enemy separation vector
eradius - the radius a drone checks for enemies to stay
            away from (in pixels)
pweight - the weight of the past movement vector (i.e. how
            much a drone wants to hold its present course)
fov - a drone's field of view (i.e. how many degrees the
        drone can see away from its current heading in
        either direction)

To modify the above values, essages should take the 
following form:

  <team number> <keyword> <new value>

The team number allows you to send messages just to one 
particular team, or else use 0 if you want to broadcast 
your message to everyone. The keywords are listed above.
Finally, provide a new value to update the specified
keyword. Examples of valid commands are given below:

0 mobile 1
1 cweight 2
2 fov 90
0 sradius 75

Two exceptions to the standard message format given above
are the "beginboids" and "endboids" commands, which are
preceded by a team number but require no new value. While
you can adjust each of the boids values (alignment, 
cohesion, etc.) individually using the keywords listed,
"beginboids" sets all the values at once so that you can
go from aimless flying to flocking in just one command.
"endboids" returns the drones to aimless flying.

From my own experience, the following boids values yield
fairly good flocking behavior (and these values are
consequently used to implement the "beginboids" command).

0 eradius 200
0 eweight 5
0 sradius 100
0 sweight 5
0 aweight 4
0 cweight 2
0 fov 180
