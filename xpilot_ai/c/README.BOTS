Here's a run-down of the different bots in this directory:

1. Spinner: One of the base bots from the AI library. Just spins.

2. Helper: Another of the base bots. Spins and shoots.

3. MapDebugBot: Yet another base bots, just calls a few functions from
        the AI library.

4. Defender: The first bot we designed while learning the AI library
and playing around with stuff. Reads from a configuration file (
base_defense_react_config.sh ) and will either attempt to defend a 
certain point in the map or attack it. 
Played around with attack & defend scenarios, has characteristics such
as rally-points ( assigned defensive spot ), elasticity ( how far away
it is willing to move away from its defensive spot ), combat engagement 
ranges, etc.
Scripts: runHeadOn* , different variations of the same spawn script.
         runGridReactionary.sh, testing out a pseudo ground-movement implementation.
         runDepthTest.sh, testing out mechanics for an in-depth defense with            leaders.
        runStationary.sh, a defender that stays in his defensive position.
        runReactionary.sh, a defender that is aggressive

5. Boids: Matt's last big experiment, implementation of the boids algorithm, you've seen videos on this. Lots of good documentation.
    Scripts:
        runBoids.sh

6. Chaser: The name is misleading, this bot was Matt's sandbox and can do all sorts of stuff. It includes dynamic operator-in-the-loop behavior switching, a couple of different behaviors, path-finding, etc. Lots of good documentation in these files, so look there.
