# Glossary & Background

* Robot
    * A computer controlled unit provided by xpilot.

* Bot
    * A computer controlled unit developed at Leidos. Interface is provided by xpilot-ai, with bot behavior being implemented by Leidos.

* Epigenetics
    * The study of heritable changes in phenotype that does not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence.

* Epigenetic Development
    * During early stages of development (meiosis, mitosis) cells divide and differentiate to take on an type and specialize in organs. All your cells have the same DNA, but serve completely different functions. 

* Epigenetic Inheritance
    * Processes by which heritable modifications in gene function are passed to future generations without changes in the base sequence of the DNA.

* Epigenetic Regulation (main project focus)
    * **type I** - You have your DNA, but not everything is expressed (on) at the same time.
        portions are "zipped". Epigenetics controls what parts of DNA are active. 
        Think of this as a commenting out a part of a function in code.

    * **type II** - "DNA modification" - a protein (maybe other things as well?) binds to active DNA. 
        alters the behavior of the DNA and what it produces. Think of this as a parameter that 
        changes the output of a function. 

* Gene Expression 
    - The process by which the DNA instructions in the gene are converted to functional products (such as proteins), which in turn dictate cell function.

* Phenotype
    - The observable physical traits or biochemical characteristics of an organism based on a combination of the organism's genes and environmental factors.

* Genotype
    - The inherited genetic makeup of a cell.

* Subsumption
    - Behavior/reaction to a stimuli. Ants react to pheromone, not something they think about.
