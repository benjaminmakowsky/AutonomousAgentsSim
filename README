Install instructions:

1. Xpilot-engine install instructions
These versions of XPilot use the (slightly) more modern GNU Autoconf system to generate the Makefiles, so run the configure shell script in the root of the source tree (‘./configure’).  This script automatically detects your system type and attempt to determine what libraries, includes, and dependancies are available (and will stop if a critical component is missing). 
 
  After that's done, run ‘make’ and let it compile away; this usually takes a few minutes.  If there are errors, consult the INSTALL or INSTALL.TXT file.
  
  After make is finished, run ‘make install’ to install the programs, maps, and textures.  Note that this requires root privileges if installing to /usr/local (or privileges allowing you to run make using sudo.  Ask your administrator).  For 4.5.5 and earlier, you also have to run ‘make install.man’ to install the man pages. 

2. Xpilot_bitmaps install instructions.
Simply run the install script.
